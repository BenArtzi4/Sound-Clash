### Deployment Scripts

1. ✅ `deploy-task-2.3.ps1` - Complete deployment automation
2. ✅ `verify-task-2.3.ps1` - Comprehensive verification tests
3. ✅ `TASK_2.3_README.md` - Full documentation

## 🚀 READY TO DEPLOY

### Commands to Run (in order):

```powershell
# 1. Deploy everything (backend + frontend)
cd C:\Users\galbenar\Sound-Clash
.\deploy-task-2.3.ps1

# 2. Verify deployment
.\verify-task-2.3.ps1

# 3. Manual testing
# Open: https://d3ipoiakfzt21m.cloudfront.net
# Create game, then test:
# - Manager: /manager/{gameCode}
# - Teams: /game/{gameCode}/waiting
```

## 📋 What Will Happen When You Deploy

### Step 1: Backend Deployment (2-3 minutes)
- Builds Docker image with enhanced WebSocket service
- Pushes to ECR
- Forces ECS service redeployment
- Waits for service to stabilize

### Step 2: Frontend Deployment (1-2 minutes)
- Builds React app with new components
- Deploys to S3
- Invalidates CloudFront cache

### Step 3: Verification (30 seconds)
- Tests all HTTP endpoints
- Verifies WebSocket service health
- Checks frontend accessibility

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deployment, you should test:

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Create a game
- [ ] Open waiting room as Team 1
- [ ] Join with team name
- [ ] Open another tab as Team 2
- [ ] Verify Team 2 appears in Team 1's view in real-time

### Manager Console
- [ ] Open manager console with game code
- [ ] Verify all teams visible
- [ ] Test kick functionality
- [ ] Verify kicked team disappears from all views
- [ ] Test start game with 2+ teams

### Connection Resilience
- [ ] Disconnect/reconnect network
- [ ] Close and reopen browser tab
- [ ] Verify auto-reconnection works

## 📊 Expected Results

### WebSocket Service Health Check
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "websocket-service",
  "version": "2.3.0",
  "active_games": 0,
  "total_teams": 0
}
```

### After Creating Game and Joining Teams
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "2.3.0",
  "active_games": 1,
  "total_teams": 2
}
```

### Game Status Check
```json
{
  "game_code": "ABC123",
  "status": "waiting",
  "teams": [
    {
      "name": "Team Awesome",
      "joined_at": "2025-09-29T...",
      "connected": true
    }
  ],
  "total_teams": 1,
  "manager_connected": true
}
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

All of these should work after deployment:

✅ Teams can join via WebSocket
✅ Real-time updates appear instantly
✅ Manager console shows all teams
✅ Manager can kick teams
✅ Manager can start game
✅ Heartbeat maintains connections
✅ Auto-reconnection on disconnect
✅ Error messages display properly
✅ Beautiful, responsive UI
✅ No console errors

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:

1. **Check WebSocket service logs:**
   ```powershell
   aws logs tail /ecs/websocket-service --follow
   ```

2. **Check ALB health:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://sound-clash-alb-1680771077.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
   ```

3. **Check debug info:**
   ```powershell
   curl http://sound-clash-alb-1680771077.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/debug
   ```

4. **Browser console:**
   - Open DevTools → Console
   - Look for WebSocket connection errors
   - Check for [WebSocket] log messages
