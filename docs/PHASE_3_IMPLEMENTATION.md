# Phase 3: Game State Transitions - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

Complete game state management system for transitioning from waiting room to active gameplay.

### Components Created

**1. Game State Models** (`models/game_state.py`)
- `GameState`: waiting → playing → finished
- `RoundState`: not_started → song_playing → buzzer_locked → evaluating → completed
- Data models: `GameData`, `RoundData`, `SongInfo`, `BuzzerPress`, `TeamAnswer`, `RoundScore`

**2. Song Selector Service** (`services/song_selector.py`)
- Communicates with Song Management Service
- Selects random songs from specified genres
- Excludes already-played songs
- Returns song info (title, artist, youtube_id)

**3. Round Manager Service** (`services/round_manager.py`)
- Creates and manages games
- Handles round lifecycle (start, end)
- Manages buzzer presses (first team locks buzzer)
- Processes answer submissions
- Manager evaluation and scoring
- Calculates points: Song (10), Artist (5), Movie/TV (5)
- Handles timeouts (-2 points)
- Determines winner

## Game Flow

```
1. WAITING → Manager clicks "Start Game"
2. PLAYING → Start Round 1
   - Select random song from genres
   - Song plays from 5-second mark
   - Buzzers active
3. Team buzzes → Buzzer locked to that team
4. Team submits answer
5. Manager evaluates (correct/incorrect for each field)
6. Points awarded, round ends
7. Next round starts (repeat 2-6)
8. After max rounds → FINISHED, winner determined
```

## Scoring System

- **Song name correct**: +10 points
- **Artist correct**: +5 points
- **Movie/TV correct**: +5 points
- **Buzzer timeout**: -2 points
- **Wrong answer**: 0 points
- **Max per round**: 20 points

```

## Testing

### Local Test (No Database Needed)
```powershell
.\scripts\test-game-state-local.ps1
```

Tests:
- Game state models can be created
- Services initialize correctly
- Round manager creates games and transitions states

### CloudShell Test (Full Integration)
```bash
cd ~/Sound-Clash
chmod +x scripts/cloudshell/test-game-state.sh
./scripts/cloudshell/test-game-state.sh
```

Tests:
- All local tests
- Database connection
- Song data availability

## Next Steps

**Phase 3 Remaining Work:**
1. Update `main_simple.py` to integrate round manager
2. Add WebSocket message handlers for:
   - Start game
   - Start round
   - Buzzer press
   - Submit answer
   - Manager evaluation
3. Add manager control endpoints
4. Broadcast state changes to all clients

**Phase 4 (Future):**
- Frontend GamePlayPage with YouTube player
- Buzzer button UI
- Answer submission form

**Phase 5 (Future):**
- Manager evaluation interface
- Real-time scoreboard
- Winner announcement

## Dependencies

Added to `requirements.txt`:
- `aiohttp` - For song selector HTTP requests
- `pydantic` - For data models (already present)

## Design Decisions

1. **Fixed 5-second start**: All songs start at 5 seconds (simplified)
2. **In-memory game state**: Games stored in RoundManager (ephemeral)
3. **Manager evaluation**: Points decided by manager, not automatic
4. **First buzzer wins**: Once buzzer pressed, others locked out
5. **Single answer attempt**: Team gets one chance per round

## Architecture

```
WebSocket Service
├── Models (data structures)
├── Services (business logic)
│   ├── SongSelector → Song Management API
│   └── RoundManager → Game/Round lifecycle
└── main_simple.py (to be updated)
    └── WebSocket handlers
```

Song Management Service provides songs via REST API.
Round Manager orchestrates game flow.
WebSocket broadcasts state changes to all connected clients.
