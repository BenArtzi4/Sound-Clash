# Sound Clash - Simplified Buzzer Game Architecture

## Project Overview

Building an AWS-native multi-room pop culture buzzer game where teams compete to identify songs and artists/content. This is a **social verbal game** where teams speak their answers and the manager evaluates them in real-time. **SIMPLIFIED VERSION** - no AI selection, no heatmap processing, fixed 5-second start time for all songs.

=======

## Three Screen Types

The application has three distinct screen types for different roles:

### 1. Team Screen (Mobile/Tablet)
**Purpose**: Simple buzzer interface only
**Device**: One mobile device per team
**Audio**: No audio (teams hear from manager's device)

### 2. Manager Screen (Laptop/Desktop)
**Purpose**: Full game control and answer evaluation
**Device**: Manager's laptop/desktop
**Audio**: YouTube player audio through room speakers

### 3. Display Screen (TV/Projector)
**Purpose**: Public view everyone watches
**Device**: Large TV or projector
**Audio**: No audio (no YouTube player, only scoreboard and info)

## Core Game Mechanics (Simplified)

### Song System
- **Fixed Start Time**: All songs start at 5 seconds
- **Single Difficulty**: No difficulty levels or variations
- **Simple Selection**: Random selection from filtered genres
- **Basic Metadata**: Title, Artist (or Content for soundtracks), YouTube ID, Genres only
- **Genre-Based Fields**: Regular songs have Artist, Soundtrack songs have Content (movie/TV/show)

### Scoring System (Verbal Answer Evaluation)
- **Fixed Points**: 
  - Song name: 10 pts
  - Artist OR Content: 5 pts (depends on genre)
- **Total Possible**: 15 points per round (not 20)
- **Penalties**: Wrong answer (-2 points)
- **No Timeouts**: Manager decides when to move on

### Answer Mechanism (Social/Verbal)
- Teams **speak** their answers out loud (not typed)
- Manager **listens** and evaluates verbally given answers
- Manager has buttons to approve/decline each component
- Teams can answer multiple components in one buzz if they know them
- Each component can be answered separately across multiple buzz cycles

### Game Flow
1. Manager creates game and selects genres
2. Teams join with any Unicode names (waiting room)
3. Manager starts game
4. Manager starts round ‚Üí System randomly picks song from selected genre
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
5. Song plays from 5-second mark, all buzzers enabled
=======
5. Song plays from 5-second mark on manager's YouTube player, audio through room speakers
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
6. First team buzzes ‚Üí **All buzzers lock**
7. Team **speaks** answer(s) out loud
8. Manager evaluates and approves/declines each component:
   - ‚úì Approve Song Name ‚Üí +10pts, locks song name component
   - ‚úì Approve Artist/Content ‚Üí +5pts, locks artist/content component
   - ‚úó Wrong Answer ‚Üí -2pts, nothing locked
9. Manager clicks "Restart Song" when ready
10. Song restarts from 5 seconds, buzzers re-enable (for unlocked components)
11. Repeat buzz cycles until both components answered OR manager skips round
12. Manager starts next round or ends game

### Round Completion
A round ends when:
- **Both components locked** (song name + artist/content answered correctly), OR
- **Manager skips round** (no penalties, move to next song)

Game continues until manager manually ends it (no max rounds).

## Simplified Database Schema

**PostgreSQL (Persistent Data):**
- `songs`: id, title, artist, youtube_id, created_at, is_active
- `genres`: id, name, slug, category, is_active  
- `song_genres`: song_id, genre_id (many-to-many)
- `game_history`: game_id, songs_played, teams, winner (optional)

**DynamoDB (Ephemeral, 4-hour TTL):**
- `active_games`: gameCode, teams, current_song, scores, settings
- `game_sessions`: gameCode, roundId, song_id, locked_components, scores_this_round
- `buzz_events`: gameCode, timestamp, team_name, reaction_time
- `team_connections`: gameCode, teamName, connection_status

## Simplified Architecture Components

### Backend Services
1. **Game Management Service** - Game lifecycle, team joining, waiting room
2. **Song Management Service** - Basic CRUD operations, simple selection
3. **WebSocket Service** - Real-time communication, buzzer logic, scoring
4. **Manager Console Service** - Host interface, answer evaluation
5. **Public Display Service** - Spectator interface

### Song Selection Logic (Simplified)
```
Random Selection Algorithm:
1. Filter songs by selected genre(s)
2. Exclude recently played songs (same game)
3. Random selection from remaining pool
4. Return song with fixed 5-second start time
5. Include genre info (is_soundtrack) to determine if Artist or Content field applies
```

### Genre Categories (Simplified)
- **Israeli Music**: Israeli Rock, Israeli Pop, Hafla, Israeli Classics
- **Musical Styles**: Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop, Electronic, Country, R&B
- **Decades**: 60s-70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, 2010s, 2020s
- **Media (Soundtracks)**: Movie Soundtracks, TV Themes, Disney, Video Games

**Important**: Soundtrack genres use "Content" (movie/TV name) instead of "Artist"
