# Sound Clash - Simplified Project Structure (Updated)

## Project Overview

Building an AWS-native multi-room pop culture buzzer game where teams compete to identify songs and artists/content. This is a **social verbal game** where teams speak their answers and the manager evaluates them in real-time. **SIMPLIFIED VERSION** - no AI selection, no heatmap processing, fixed 5-second start time for all songs.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======

## Three Screen Types

The application has three distinct screen types for different roles:

### 1. Team Screen (Mobile/Tablet)
**Purpose**: Simple buzzer interface for each team
**Device**: One mobile device per team
**Audio**: No audio (teams hear from manager's device)
**Pages**:
- Join Page - Enter game code and team name
- Buzzer Page - Large buzzer button with minimal feedback

### 2. Manager Screen (Laptop/Desktop)
**Purpose**: Full game control and answer evaluation
**Device**: Manager's laptop/desktop
**Audio**: YouTube player audio through room speakers
**Pages**:
- Create Game - Select genres, generate code
- Waiting Room - See teams, start game
- Manager Console - YouTube player, evaluation, controls

### 3. Display Screen (TV/Projector)
**Purpose**: Public view everyone watches
**Device**: Large TV or projector
**Audio**: No audio (no YouTube player)
**Pages**:
- Pre-Game - Game code, QR code, joined teams
- Main Display - Scoreboard, round info, notifications
- Winner Screen - Final scores, celebration

## Simplified Game Logic

### Song System
- **Fixed Start Time**: All songs start at 5 seconds
- **No Difficulty Levels**: Single difficulty for all songs
- **Simple Selection**: Random selection from filtered genres
- **Basic Metadata**: Title, Artist (or Content for soundtracks), YouTube ID, Genres only
- **Genre-Based Answer Fields**: 
  - Regular songs: Song Name + Artist
  - Soundtrack songs: Song Name + Content (movie/TV/show)

### Scoring System (Verbal Answers)
- **Fixed Points**: Song name (10 pts), Artist/Content (5 pts)
- **No Difficulty Multipliers**: Same points for all songs
- **Total Possible**: 15 points per round (not 20)
- **Penalties**: Wrong answer (-2 pts)
- **No Timeouts**: Manager controls game pace

### Answer Mechanism
- **Verbal Answers**: Teams speak out loud, manager listens
- **Manager Evaluation**: Manager clicks buttons to approve/decline
- **Component Locking**: Each correct answer locks that component
- **Multiple Attempts**: Buzzers re-enable after evaluation until all components locked
- **Multiple Components**: Teams can answer both in one buzz if they know them

### Database Schema (Simplified)

**PostgreSQL Tables:**
```sql
-- Songs table (simple)
songs: id, title, artist, youtube_id, created_at, updated_at, is_active

-- Genres table (basic categories)
genres: id, name, slug, category, is_active

-- Song-Genre relationship
song_genres: song_id, genre_id

-- Game history (optional for later)
game_history: game_id, songs_played, teams, winner, created_at
```

**Game State (In-Memory for now, DynamoDB later):**
```
active_games: {
  gameCode: string,
  state: "waiting" | "playing" | "finished",
  teams: [{name, score}],
  current_round: {
    song_id: int,
    song_name: string,
    artist_or_content: string,
    youtube_id: string,
    is_soundtrack: boolean,
    locked_components: {
      song_name: boolean,
      artist_content: boolean
    }
  },
  rounds_played: int
}
```
