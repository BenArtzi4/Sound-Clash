# Sound Clash: API Contracts

This is the wire-format contract between the frontend and the backend (FastAPI on Render + Supabase). It is the document the frontend codes against and the backend implements. Drift between this doc and reality is a bug.

## 1. Overview

Three categories of API:

| Category | Transport | Endpoint | Authn |
|---|---|---|---|
| **REST (FastAPI)** | HTTPS | `https://api.soundclash.org` | `X-Manager-Token` for `/games/{code}/*` host actions (incl. the `rejoin-token` reveal); `X-Admin-Password` for `/admin/songs/*`; nothing for game creation, joining, `/games/{code}/rejoin` (the rejoin token in the body is the credential), or `/genres` |
| **Postgres RPC (PostgREST)** | HTTPS | `https://<project>.supabase.co/rest/v1/rpc/<fn>` | Supabase **anon key** in `apikey` + `Authorization` headers |
| **Realtime (Supabase)** | WebSocket | `wss://<project>.supabase.co/realtime/v1` | Supabase **anon key** |

All payloads are JSON. All timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC with `Z` suffix (e.g., `2026-05-03T14:23:01.234Z`).

All responses include the conventional fields:
- Success: HTTP 2xx + body specified per endpoint.
- Error: HTTP 4xx/5xx + `{ "error": "<machine_code>", "message": "<human readable>", "details": <optional> }`.

Canonical error codes: `validation_error`, `unauthorized`, `forbidden`, `not_found`, `conflict`, `gone`, `rate_limited`, `internal_error`.

---

## 2. REST Endpoints (FastAPI)

### 2.1 `GET /health`

Liveness probe. No auth.

**Response 200**:
```json
{ "status": "ok", "version": "<git_sha>", "supabase": "ok" }
```

`supabase` is `"ok"` if the server can reach Supabase, `"degraded"` otherwise (still 200; the server is up).

---

### 2.2 `POST /games`

Create a new game. **No auth.** Anyone can host. Rate-limited 10/min/IP.

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "selected_genres": ["<genre_uuid>", "..."],
  "selected_decades": [1980, 1990]
}
```

Validation:
- `selected_genres`: at least 1 genre UUID
- `selected_decades` (optional): array of decade start-years (the 80s = `1980`), each in `[1900, 2100]`. Omitted or empty means no year limit. The song picker (`select_next_song`) serves only songs whose `release_year` falls in one of these decades; see `rpc-functions.md §3c`.

Games run for as many rounds as the host wants and end only when the host calls `POST /games/{code}/end`. There is no per-game round limit.

**Response 201**:
```json
{
  "game_code": "ABCDEF",
  "status": "waiting",
  "selected_genres": ["..."],
  "selected_decades": [1980, 1990],
  "started_at": "2026-05-03T14:23:01.234Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-05-03T18:23:01.234Z",
  "manager_token": "1f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8190-a1b2c3d4e5f6"
}
```

The `manager_token` is generated server-side (`gen_random_uuid()`, stored in `game_secrets`) and is the host's credential for every host-only call. The host's browser stores it in `localStorage` under `game:<code>:manager-token` and presents it as `X-Manager-Token` on the remaining host-only REST endpoints (`bonus`, `end`, kick-team) and as the `p_manager_token` argument on the browser-direct RPCs (`award_attempt`, `release_buzz_lock`, `select_next_song`, `peek_next_song`, `extend_game`). The token stays on the host's device unless the host deliberately exports it via the console's **Backup host link** (`/manager/game/<code>#mt=<token>`, URL fragment — see `security-rls.md` §1), which is how a wiped or second browser recovers host access.

Game-code generation: 6 chars from `ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789` (no 0/O, 1/I/L, no lowercase). On collision (UNIQUE violation), retry up to 5 times then 500.

**Errors**: `validation_error` (400), `rate_limited` (429).

---

### 2.3 `POST /games/{game_code}/teams`

Team joins a game. **No auth.** Anyone with the game code can call this.

**Idempotent on team name (T5.7 / F-P2-1):** joining with a name that already
exists in the same game returns that existing team (same `id`, preserved
`score`) with a 201 instead of creating a duplicate row. A player who refreshed
or lost their tab can rejoin with the same name and resume their team.

**Request body**:
```json
{ "name": "Team Awesome" }
```

Validation:
- `name`: 1–30 chars, trimmed; no leading/trailing whitespace. Uniqueness within
  the game is backed by a UNIQUE `(game_code, name)` constraint; the handler
  reclaims a matching existing row before inserting, so a same-name rejoin is a
  successful reclaim rather than a conflict.
- **Sanitization (T5.2):** control, line/paragraph-separator, zero-width, and
  bidirectional override/isolate characters are stripped from the name before
  the length check (they can scramble the projector or leave permanent junk in
  `game_history`). Hebrew/RTL and emoji — including ZWJ compound emoji — are
  preserved. A name that is nothing but stripped characters collapses to empty
  and is rejected as a `validation_error`.

**Response 201**:
```json
{
  "id": "<team_uuid>",
  "game_code": "ABCDEF",
  "name": "Team Awesome",
  "score": 0,
  "joined_at": "2026-05-03T14:25:11.000Z"
}
```

The frontend stores `id` in `localStorage` keyed by `game_code` for reconnection.

**Errors**: `validation_error` (400; bad name), `not_found` (404; game doesn't exist), `gone` (410; game expired or ended). A same-name rejoin no longer 409s (it reclaims the existing team); a `conflict` (409) can still surface only in the narrow race where two simultaneous same-name joins both pass the reclaim SELECT and the UNIQUE constraint rejects the second INSERT.

---

### 2.3a `POST /games/{game_code}/rejoin`

Reconnect a device to an **existing** team via that team's per-team rejoin
token — for a team that lost its device (dead phone, closed tab, a different
device) and needs its *exact* row back (same `id`, preserved `score`). Issue
#183. **No auth** in the header sense: the rejoin token in the body **is** the
credential (a 128-bit uuid). Rate-limited 30/min/IP. This creates nothing — it
resolves the token, not a new team.

The token reaches the player from a host-shown QR of the form
`…/join/<CODE>#rt=<token>` (URL **fragment**, like the host `#mt=` recovery
link — see `security-rls.md` §1); the browser reads it out of the fragment and
posts it here. The token is disclosed to the host only via the
manager-token-gated `GET /games/{code}/teams/{id}/rejoin-token` (§2.8a) — it is
never returned to players by the join endpoint and never stored in player
`localStorage`.

**Request body**:
```json
{ "token": "1f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8190-a1b2c3d4e5f6" }
```

**Response 200** (same shape as the join response — the existing team, **not** a new one):
```json
{
  "id": "<team_uuid>",
  "game_code": "ABCDEF",
  "name": "Team Awesome",
  "score": 14,
  "joined_at": "2026-05-03T14:25:11.000Z"
}
```

The backend resolves the token in the anon-invisible `team_secrets` table
(migration 046, scoped by `(game_code, rejoin_token)`), then re-reads the team
row it points at. There is no new SECURITY DEFINER RPC — the service-role
backend reads `team_secrets` directly. Off the buzzer hot path (a rejoin
happens at most once when a device reconnects).

**Errors**: `validation_error` (400; token isn't a valid uuid), `not_found`
(404; the game doesn't exist **or** the token matches no team in it), `gone`
(410; game expired or ended). A wrong-but-well-formed token is a plain 404 —
the same response a real host's stale link would get — so the endpoint doesn't
distinguish "no such team" from "no such game".

---

### 2.4 Advancing the round — direct Postgres RPC (no FastAPI hop)

Manager presses "Next round" / "Start game". The browser calls the
``select_next_song`` PL/pgSQL function directly via Supabase PostgREST.
Migration 022 added the function; what used to be two chained Render
round-trips (`POST /end-round` + `POST /select-song`) is now one direct
call that picks a song, closes any still-open prior round (via the
existing `start_round` defensive close), and inserts the new `game_rounds`
row. The legacy REST endpoints `/select-song` and `/end-round` were
removed once the direct-RPC path had stabilised on prod (migration 023 /
the dead-code cleanup PR).

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc("select_next_song", {
  p_game_code: gameCode,
  p_manager_token: managerToken,
  p_song_id: null,   // null = random pick; uuid = manual pick
});
```

Frontend wrapper: `frontend/src/hooks/useSelectNextSong.ts::selectNextSongDirect`.

**Response** (single row from a RETURNS TABLE; PostgREST surfaces it as an array):
```json
[{
  "round_id": "<round_uuid>",
  "round_number": 3,
  "song_id": "<song_uuid>",
  "song_title": "Song Title",
  "song_artist": "Artist Name",
  "youtube_id": "dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "start_time": 30,
  "is_soundtrack": false
}]
```

**Errors** (raised as PostgrestError with the named code in `message`):
- `manager_token_required` (sqlstate `28000`) — bad/missing token.
- `game_not_found` (`P0002`) — game code unknown.
- `game_ended` (`P0001`) — game already ended.
- `no_genres_selected` (`22023`) — game has no `selected_genres`.
- `no_more_songs` (`22023`) — pool exhausted on the random path.
- `song_not_found` (`P0002`) — manual pick referenced a missing song id.

---

### 2.5 Scoring an attempt — direct Postgres RPC (no FastAPI hop)

Migration 021 moved scoring off FastAPI: the manager browser calls the
``award_attempt`` PL/pgSQL function directly via Supabase PostgREST, the
same way the buzzer calls ``buzz_in``. Removing the Render round-trip drops
manager-action latency from ~400-600ms to ~150ms.

The function takes the per-game `manager_token` as its last argument and
validates it (constant comparison on a fixed-width uuid) before performing
any side effect. See `docs/rpc-functions.md §3` for the full signature and
`docs/security-rls.md §2` for the auth model.

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc("award_attempt", {
  p_game_code: gameCode,
  p_round_id: roundId,
  p_correct_title: titleCorrect,
  p_correct_artist: artistCorrect,
  p_wrong: wrongBuzz,
  p_manager_token: managerToken,
});
```

Frontend wrapper: `frontend/src/hooks/useManagerActions.ts::awardAttemptDirect`
(shape normalisation only — the flags go on the wire as booleans).

**Scoring authority (migration 043, T7.1).** The wire carries only booleans; the
DB derives the magnitudes (`+10 / +5 / −3`), so the client can't send an arbitrary
value. Migration 043 added this boolean overload **alongside** the legacy integer
one (`p_title / p_artist / p_wrong_buzz`, mig 036) so the two could be deployed
independently; migration 044 then dropped the integer overload once the
boolean-sending frontend had soaked, leaving the boolean signature as the sole
overload. See `rpc-functions.md §3`.

**Behavior**:
- `p_correct_title = true` → +10 to the buzzed team; claims the TITLE token.
- `p_correct_artist = true` → +5 to the buzzed team; claims the ARTIST token.
- Both → +15 in one shot (claims both tokens) — this is how a soundtrack round scores.
- `p_wrong = true` → −3 to the buzzed team. Mutually exclusive with the two above; if a token was already claimed earlier in the round the SQL function waives the penalty (free-guess rule, migration 017).
- The buzz lock is **only** cleared on the wrong-buzz path. A correct attempt leaves `active_games.buzzed_team_id` and `locked_at` in place — the answering team retains the floor for the other token until the manager presses Continue or Next round.

**Errors** (raised as PostgrestError with the named code in `message`):
- `manager_token_required` (sqlstate `28000`) — bad/missing token.
- `game_not_found` (sqlstate `P0002`) — game code unknown.
- `game_ended` (sqlstate `P0001`) — game already ended.
- `round_not_found` (sqlstate `P0002`), `round_already_ended` (P0001), `no_buzz_to_score` (P0001), `title_already_claimed` / `artist_already_claimed` (P0001), `wrong_buzz_with_correct` (P0001).

---

### 2.5a Releasing the buzz lock — direct Postgres RPC

Manager presses Continue (resume the song without scoring). Same direct-RPC
pattern as 2.5; the function checks the manager token internally.

```ts
const { error } = await supabase.rpc("release_buzz_lock", {
  p_game_code: gameCode,
  p_manager_token: managerToken,
});
```

Frontend wrapper: `frontend/src/hooks/useManagerActions.ts::releaseBuzzLockDirect`.

Idempotent: safe to call when no buzz is held. Errors mirror 2.5 (token / game lookup).

---

### 2.5b End-round (folded into `select_next_song`)

There is no longer a separate `POST /games/{game_code}/end-round` REST
endpoint or `end_round` direct-RPC call from the browser. Closing the
previous round is handled inside `select_next_song` (which delegates to
the existing PL/pgSQL `start_round` function — that one defensively
closes any open prior round before inserting the new one). The host
never explicitly "ends a round"; they advance to the next song and the
prior round is closed as a side effect, identical to the pre-cleanup
behaviour.

The service-role-only `end_round` PL/pgSQL function still exists in the
DB and is callable from within `select_next_song` and `start_round`; it
just has no FastAPI route or browser caller anymore.

---

### 2.5c Extending the game TTL — direct Postgres RPC

Host clicks **Keep playing +1h** in the manager console's expiry warning
banner (shown in the last ~20 minutes before `expires_at`). Same direct-RPC
pattern as 2.5; the function checks the manager token internally and pushes
`active_games.expires_at` to `GREATEST(expires_at, now()) + 1 hour`
(migration 039).

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc("extend_game", {
  p_game_code: gameCode,
  p_manager_token: managerToken,
});
```

Frontend wrapper: `frontend/src/hooks/useManagerActions.ts::extendGameDirect`.

**Response**: the new `expires_at` as a bare JSON timestamp string (the
function `RETURNS timestamptz`). The authoritative countdown update reaches
every client via the Realtime `UPDATE` on `active_games`.

**Errors** (raised as PostgrestError with the named code in `message`):
- `manager_token_required` (sqlstate `28000`) — bad/missing token.
- `game_not_found` (`P0002`) — game code unknown.
- `game_ended` (`P0001`) — game already ended; nothing to keep playing.

---

### 2.6 `POST /games/{game_code}/bonus`

Manager: award a discretionary bonus to any team in the game. Independent of round state and the buzz lock; the host picks the team. **Manager-token auth required.**

**Headers**: `X-Manager-Token: <token>`

**Request body**:
```json
{
  "team_id": "<team_uuid>",
  "points": 4
}
```

`points` is optional and defaults to `4`. Must be `>= 1`.

**Response 200**:
```json
{
  "team_id": "<team_uuid>",
  "points_awarded": 4,
  "team_total_score": 18
}
```

Server-side: calls Postgres `award_bonus` RPC. Does not touch round state.

**Errors**: `unauthorized` (401), `not_found` (404; team not in this game, or game does not exist), `conflict` (409; game already ended), `validation_error` (400; non-positive `points`).

---

### 2.7 `POST /games/{game_code}/end`

Manager: end the game manually. **Manager-token auth required.**

**Headers**: `X-Manager-Token: <token>`

**Response 200**:
```json
{
  "game_code": "ABCDEF",
  "status": "ended",
  "ended_at": "2026-05-03T15:48:00.000Z"
}
```

**Errors**: `unauthorized` (401), `not_found` (404), `conflict` (409; already ended).

---

### 2.8 `DELETE /games/{game_code}/teams/{team_id}`

Manager: kick a team. **Manager-token auth required.**

**Headers**: `X-Manager-Token: <token>`

**Response 204** (no body).

Cascade: any future actions by the kicked team are rejected because their row is gone. Their browser detects the Realtime DELETE event and redirects to a "you've been kicked" screen.

**Errors**: `unauthorized` (401), `not_found` (404).

---

### 2.8a `GET /games/{game_code}/teams/{team_id}/rejoin-token`

Reveal a team's per-team rejoin token to the authenticated host, so the manager
console can render a "Reconnect a team" rescue QR the player scans on a new or
borrowed device (issue #183). **Manager-token auth required.** This is the
**only** endpoint that ever discloses a rejoin token, and only to the host —
the token is never returned to players by the join endpoint. Rate-limited
100/min/IP.

**Headers**: `X-Manager-Token: <token>`

**Response 200**:
```json
{
  "team_id": "<team_uuid>",
  "rejoin_token": "1f1a2b3c-4d5e-6f70-8190-a1b2c3d4e5f6"
}
```

The host builds the scan link `…/join/<game_code>#rt=<rejoin_token>` from this
(the token rides the URL **fragment**, so it never reaches server logs); the
player's browser then calls `POST /games/{code}/rejoin` (§2.3a).

**Errors**: `unauthorized` (401; missing/wrong manager token), `not_found`
(404; unknown `team_id` under a valid manager token), `gone` (410; game ended).

---

### 2.9 `GET /genres`

Public. List all genres.

**Response 200**:
```json
[
  { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Rock", "slug": "rock" },
  { "id": "<uuid>", "name": "Pop",  "slug": "pop"  }
]
```

> **Note:** the SPA no longer calls this endpoint. The "Host a game" genre picker reads the anon-readable `genres` table **directly from Supabase** (`from('genres').select('id,name,slug').order('name')`) so it never waits on a cold Render container. This endpoint is retained for smoke tests and any external caller; its contract is unchanged.

---

### 2.10 Admin Songs CRUD

All under `/admin/songs/*`. **Admin-password auth required** on every endpoint (`X-Admin-Password` header). This is the only surface that still uses the global admin password; game hosting is open.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET`    | `/admin/songs` | List songs (paginated, `?page=1&per_page=50&search=&genre=`) |
| `GET`    | `/admin/songs/{id}` | Get one song |
| `POST`   | `/admin/songs` | Create a song (body: `title, artist, youtube_id, start_time, genre_ids[]`). Tagging the song with a soundtrack genre (Soundtracks / Israeli Soundtracks) is what makes it a +15 soundtrack round — there is no separate flag. For soundtracks, `artist` holds the film/show name (the answer revealed on screen) and `title` holds the song/clip name (shown only as a hint); set `title = artist` when there is no distinct song. |
| `PUT`    | `/admin/songs/{id}` | Update a song (full replacement; partial use PATCH if needed later). Changing the `youtube_id` also clears a dead-video flag (`unavailable_at`, mig 045) — swapping in a new video makes the song playable again immediately. |
| `DELETE` | `/admin/songs/{id}` | Delete a song (cascades to `song_genres`) |
| `POST`   | `/admin/songs/bulk-import` | Multipart CSV upload; columns: `title, artist, youtube_id, start_time, genres` (semicolon-separated genre slugs). A row plays as a soundtrack round when its `genres` include `soundtracks` or `israeli-soundtracks`. |
| `POST`   | `/admin/songs/check-availability` | Probe a page of the catalog for dead YouTube videos (I-Liveness). Report-only by default; **`commit=true` persists the verdicts** so the round pickers skip dead songs (Phase 2, mig 045) — see below. |

Bulk import is idempotent on `youtube_id`: existing songs are updated, new ones are inserted.

The upload is capped at **5 MB** (the real catalog CSV is ~40 KB). An over-cap body is rejected with **`413 payload_too_large`** before it is parsed — enforced both on a declared `Content-Length` and via a streamed read, so a missing or under-declared header can't bypass the cap.

#### `POST /admin/songs/check-availability` — dead-video scan (report by default, `commit` to persist)

Probes each song's `youtube_id` against YouTube's public **oEmbed** endpoint and reports which are gone, so an admin can review/fix/delete them via the CRUD above **before** they surface as a "video unavailable" error mid-game. By default (`commit=false`) it **never writes** — it only classifies.

The catalog is ~1025 songs and each probe is a network round-trip, so the endpoint works **one page at a time** (worst-case wall time stays well under Render's ~100s gateway timeout). Page through the whole catalog by following `next_offset`.

Request body (all fields optional):

```jsonc
{
  "limit": 200,        // page size, 1..250 (default 200)
  "offset": 0,         // page offset (default 0)
  "song_ids": null,    // OR an explicit list of song UUIDs to probe (ignores limit/offset)
  "commit": false      // true → persist the verdicts for this page (Phase 2, mig 045)
}
```

Response `200`:

```jsonc
{
  "checked": 200,                                   // songs probed on this page
  "dead":    [{"id": "…", "youtube_id": "…", "title": "…"}],   // oEmbed 404 → removed
  "unknown": [{"id": "…", "youtube_id": "…", "title": "…"}],   // 401/400/5xx/timeout → could not confirm
  "flagged": 0,                                     // commit=true only: songs newly marked unavailable
  "cleared": 0,                                     // commit=true only: flagged songs restored to playable
  "next_offset": 200                                // offset for the next page, or null at the end
}
```

Classification is deliberately conservative so an admin never deletes a good song on a false positive: **only a definitive oEmbed `404` is `dead`**. A `401` (embed-disabled / region-blocked — may still play in the IFrame), a `400` (id YouTube rejects as malformed), any `5xx`, and any timeout/network error are all reported as **`unknown`** (surfaced for a human to eyeball, never asserted dead).

**`commit=true` (I-Liveness Phase 2, mig 045)** persists the verdicts for the probed page via the service-role-only `set_song_availability` RPC, and the semantics are self-healing:

- `dead` (oEmbed `404`) → sets `songs.unavailable_at = now()` (only if not already flagged — the timestamp records *first noticed*). Flagged songs are **skipped by `select_next_song`/`peek_next_song`**, so they never reach a round; they stay in the catalog and the admin list (`unavailable_at` is returned by the list/get endpoints).
- `ok` (oEmbed `200`) → **clears** `unavailable_at` back to `NULL`; a restored or transiently-404ing video becomes eligible again, so a transient 404 can't permanently bury a good song.
- `unknown` → never writes.

`flagged`/`cleared` count the rows whose `unavailable_at` actually changed on this page (always `0` when `commit=false`). The writer only ever touches the probed page (or the explicit `song_ids`).

---

## 3. Postgres RPC (PostgREST)

Called by the **browser** with the anon key. Six functions are exposed to anon: `buzz_in` (the hot buzzer path, documented below) plus the five token-gated host RPCs `award_attempt`, `release_buzz_lock`, `select_next_song`, `peek_next_song`, and `extend_game` — each validates the per-game `manager_token` in-body (full signatures in `rpc-functions.md`). Every other RPC is revoked from anon (mig 020).

### 3.1 `POST /rest/v1/rpc/buzz_in`

**Headers**:
- `apikey: <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>`
- `Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Body**:
```json
{ "p_game_code": "ABCDEF", "p_team_id": "<team_uuid>" }
```

**Response 200** (single-row return; PostgREST returns an array):
```json
[
  { "locked": true, "locked_team_id": "<team_uuid>", "locked_at": "2026-05-03T14:30:12.123Z" }
]
```

- `locked: true` → this caller won the lock.
- `locked: false` → the lock was already held; `locked_team_id` is whoever holds it.

This call must complete in <100ms (RTT to Supabase). Fan-out to other clients via Realtime takes another ~50–100ms.

**Errors**: PostgREST returns 4xx with `code`, `message`, `hint`. Treat anything non-200 as "buzz failed; refresh state from Realtime."

---

## 4. Supabase Realtime (Subscriptions)

The frontend uses `@supabase/supabase-js`'s `channel()` API to subscribe to row-level changes. Three subscriptions per game.

### 4.1 Channel: `game:{game_code}`

Subscribes to row changes on three tables, filtered by `game_code`:

```ts
supabase
  .channel(`game:${gameCode}`)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'active_games',
    filter: `game_code=eq.${gameCode}`
  }, handleGameChange)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'game_teams',
    filter: `game_code=eq.${gameCode}`
  }, handleTeamChange)
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'game_rounds',
    filter: `game_code=eq.${gameCode}`
  }, handleRoundChange)
  .subscribe();
```

### 4.2 Event payloads

Each `postgres_changes` callback receives:
```ts
{
  schema: 'public',
  table: 'active_games' | 'game_teams' | 'game_rounds',
  commit_timestamp: string,
  eventType: 'INSERT' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE',
  new: <row | {}>,    // present on INSERT and UPDATE
  old: <row | {}>,    // present on UPDATE and DELETE (only PK by default)
  errors: null | string[]
}
```

The frontend maintains derived state:
- **Game state**: latest `active_games` row. A `game_rounds` INSERT that is strictly ahead of the local game row ALSO advances this (status/round pointers/lock cleared): `start_round` writes both rows in one transaction, so the reducer derives the game-row transition from the surviving INSERT even when the `active_games` UPDATE event is lost (#254; see `realtime-design.md` §5).
- **Teams**: full team list, updated on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
- **Current round**: the `game_rounds` row whose id matches `active_games.current_round_id`.

### 4.3 Buzz lock event (specifically)

When a team buzzes:
1. `buzz_in` UPDATEs `active_games` setting `buzzed_team_id` and `locked_at`.
2. Realtime fires `postgres_changes` on `active_games` with `eventType: 'UPDATE'` and the new row.
3. All subscribed clients see `new.buzzed_team_id` go non-null and update their UI.

There is no separate "buzzer_locked" event type. The data model IS the event stream.

The lock *clears* the same way — an `active_games` UPDATE with `buzzed_team_id: null` (from `release_buzz_lock`, `award_attempt`'s wrong branch, or `select_next_song`). Two resilience paths cover a lost clear event: the round-advance clear is re-derived from the same-transaction `game_rounds` INSERT, and the mid-round clears are caught by the lock-aware backstop re-fetch (15s while a lock is held locally, 60s otherwise) (#254).

### 4.4 Reconnection

`supabase-js` auto-reconnects with exponential backoff. On reconnect, it re-fetches the current state via the channel. The frontend should re-fetch the latest `active_games` row via `select()` after `subscribe()` to handle missed events during the disconnect.

```ts
channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    const { data } = await supabase
      .from('active_games')
      .select('*, game_teams(*), game_rounds(*)')
      .eq('game_code', gameCode)
      .single();
    setGameState(data);
  }
});
```

### 4.5 Quotas

Free tier: 200 concurrent peers, 2M messages/month, 100 channels per client. See `free-tier-budget.md` for capacity analysis.

## 5. Headers and CORS

### CORS

FastAPI allows: `https://soundclash.org`, `https://www.soundclash.org`, and (in dev) `http://localhost:5173`.

Methods: `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`. Headers: `Content-Type, X-Admin-Password, X-Manager-Token`.

### Cache-Control

- `GET /genres`: `public, max-age=600` (genres rarely change)
- All game-state endpoints: `no-store` (game state is live)
- `GET /admin/songs`: `private, no-cache`

### Versioning

The API is unversioned at MVP. Breaking changes will introduce `/v2/` prefix. The frontend pins a known-good API SHA in `VITE_API_VERSION` for diagnostics.

## 6. Rate Limits (server-side)

FastAPI uses `slowapi` (Redis-free, in-memory):

| Endpoint | Limit | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /games` | 10 / minute / IP | Prevent game-code spam |
| `POST /games/*/teams` | 30 / minute / IP | Prevent team-spam DoS |
| `POST /games/*/rejoin` | 30 / minute / IP | Prevent rejoin-token brute force |
| `GET /games/*/teams/*/rejoin-token` | 100 / minute / IP | Host-only; conservative cap |
| `POST /admin/songs/bulk-import` | 5 / minute / IP | Heavy operation |
| `POST /admin/songs/check-availability` | 10 / minute / IP | Each call fans out network probes |
| All admin endpoints | 100 / minute / IP | Conservative cap |

`buzz_in` RPC is not rate-limited at the API layer (Postgres handles concurrency safely). Future: add Postgres-side rate limit if abuse seen.

---

## 7. Idempotency

- `POST /games`: not idempotent (each call creates a new game). Frontend must not retry on network error without user confirmation.
- `POST /games/{code}/teams`: idempotent on `(game_code, name)` — the handler SELECTs an existing team with that name and returns it (reclaim: same `id`, preserved `score`) before inserting, so a rejoin resumes the same team. The UNIQUE `(game_code, name)` constraint is the backstop for the tiny select-then-insert race.
- `select_next_song` RPC (direct from manager browser): NOT idempotent; each call advances the round number and inserts a new `game_rounds` row. The prior round is closed defensively inside the function; calling on an already-ended game raises `game_ended`.
- `award_attempt` RPC (direct from manager browser): NOT idempotent. Each call records one attempt against the open round. Manager UI guards against double-submit with a busy flag; the SQL function additionally raises `title_already_claimed` / `artist_already_claimed` on retry. Calling on an ended round raises `round_already_ended`.
- `release_buzz_lock` RPC (direct from manager browser): idempotent on the unlock side; safe to call when no buzz is held.
- `extend_game` RPC (direct from manager browser): NOT idempotent; each call adds another hour to `expires_at`. The manager UI disables the banner button from click until the bumped value arrives over Realtime, so a double-tap can't stack a second hour.
- `POST /games/{code}/end`: idempotent; calling on an already-`ended` game is a 409 (conflict), not a no-op, to surface the inconsistency to the manager UI.
- `buzz_in` RPC: implicitly idempotent (the `IS NULL` predicate prevents double-claim).

## 8. Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Pagination cursor for `/admin/songs` (offset pagination only)
- WebHooks
- API key for third parties
- Public songs API
- OpenAPI / Swagger UI (will be auto-generated by FastAPI but not formally maintained)
- gRPC, GraphQL
