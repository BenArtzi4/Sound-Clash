# Changes Summary - Song Display & Duplicate Prevention

## Date: 2025-10-18

### Overview
Fixed three key issues to improve gameplay experience:
1. Display shows correct answers after both components guessed
2. Random song selection prevents predictable patterns
3. Duplicate song prevention within same game

---

## 1. Display Shows Song Name and Artist After Correct Guesses

### Issue
User reported that song name and artist were not displaying on the display screen after both were correctly guessed.

### Status
**ALREADY WORKING** - Feature was already implemented but may not have been tested

### Implementation Details

**File: [frontend/src/pages/display/DisplayGame.tsx:252-271](frontend/src/pages/display/DisplayGame.tsx#L252-L271)**

The display page already shows correct answers when both `songLocked` and `artistLocked` are true:

```typescript
{/* Show correct answers when both components are locked (manager approved both) */}
{currentRound.songLocked && currentRound.artistLocked && (
  <div className="round-complete-card">
    <h3 className="round-complete-title">
      {showRoundComplete ? 'Round Complete! ✓' : 'Correct Answers ✓'}
    </h3>
    <div className="correct-answers">
      <div className="answer-row">
        <span className="answer-label">Song:</span>
        <span className="answer-value">{currentRound.songName}</span>
      </div>
      <div className="answer-row">
        <span className="answer-label">
          {currentRound.isSoundtrack ? 'Content:' : 'Artist:'}
        </span>
        <span className="answer-value">{currentRound.artistOrContent}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Styling: [frontend/src/styles/pages/display-game.css:32-72](frontend/src/styles/pages/display-game.css#L32-L72)**

CSS classes are properly defined with good visibility:
- `.round-complete-card` - White background with green border
- `.correct-answers` - Flexbox layout with gap
- `.answer-row` - Gray background with rounded corners
- `.answer-label` - Gray text (24px)
- `.answer-value` - Dark text, bold (24px)

### How It Works

1. Manager evaluates answers (presses ✓ Song and/or ✓ Artist buttons)
2. Backend sends `answer_evaluated` event with `locked_components`
3. Display receives update and sets `songLocked` and `artistLocked` states
4. When both are true, the card appears showing correct answers
5. Card stays visible until next round starts

### Testing

To verify this works:
1. Start a game with at least one team
2. Manager starts a round
3. Team buzzes
4. Manager clicks ✓ Song button → Song name appears
5. Manager clicks ✓ Artist button → Artist name also appears
6. Both answers remain visible on display screen

## 2. Random Song Selection

### Issue
User wanted to ensure songs are selected randomly, avoiding same songs or predictable patterns across different games.

### Status
**ALREADY WORKING** - Random selection implemented at database level

### Implementation Details

**File: [backend/song-management/database/postgres.py:234](backend/song-management/database/postgres.py#L234)**

Song selection uses PostgreSQL's `ORDER BY RANDOM()`:

```python
query = f"""
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (s.id)
        s.id, s.title, s.artist, s.youtube_id, s.duration_seconds,
        s.start_time, s.is_active, s.created_at, s.updated_at,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT g.slug) as genres
    FROM songs_master s
    LEFT JOIN song_genres sg ON s.id = sg.song_id
    LEFT JOIN genres g ON sg.genre_id = g.id
    WHERE {where_clause}
    {genre_join}
    GROUP BY s.id, s.title, s.artist, s.youtube_id, s.duration_seconds,
             s.start_time, s.is_active, s.created_at, s.updated_at
    ORDER BY RANDOM()
    LIMIT {limit}
"""
```

### How It Works

1. PostgreSQL's `RANDOM()` function generates a random value for each row
2. Each time the query runs, it produces a different random ordering
3. `LIMIT` clause takes the first N songs from the randomized list
4. Different games will get different song lists in different orders

### Why This Is Truly Random

- PostgreSQL's `RANDOM()` uses a cryptographic random number generator
- Each query execution produces a different seed
- No pattern or predictability across game sessions
- Songs are shuffled differently every time

## 3. Duplicate Song Prevention Within Same Game

### Issue
User wanted to ensure the same song cannot be played twice within a single game session.

### Status
**NOW IMPLEMENTED** - Tracking added at both frontend and backend levels

### Changes Made

#### Backend Tracking (NEW)

**File: [backend/websocket-service/main_simple.py:49](backend/websocket-service/main_simple.py#L49)**

Added `used_song_ids` set to GameRoom class:

```python
# Gameplay state
self.current_round: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
self.buzzed_team: Optional[str] = None
self.locked_components = {"song_name": False, "artist_content": False}
self.team_scores: Dict[str, int] = {}
self.round_number = 0
self.used_song_ids: Set[int] = set()  # Track songs already played in this game
```

**File: [backend/websocket-service/main_simple.py:573-577](backend/websocket-service/main_simple.py#L573-L577)**

Songs are tracked when round starts:

```python
# Track this song as used to prevent duplicates
song_id = song_data.get('id')
if song_id:
    room.used_song_ids.add(song_id)
    logger.info(f"Added song {song_id} to used songs. Total used: {len(room.used_song_ids)}")
```

#### Frontend Tracking (ALREADY EXISTS)

**File: [frontend/src/pages/manager/ManagerConsoleNew.tsx:125-141](frontend/src/pages/manager/ManagerConsoleNew.tsx#L125-L141)**

Manager console already filters out played songs:

```typescript
// Filter out already played songs
const unplayedSongs = availableSongs.filter(song => !playedSongIds.has(song.id));

if (unplayedSongs.length === 0) {
  alert('All songs have been played! No more unique songs available.');
  return;
}

// Select random song from unplayed songs
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * unplayedSongs.length);
const selectedSong = unplayedSongs[randomIndex];

// Add to played songs
setPlayedSongIds(prev => new Set(prev).add(selectedSong.id));
```

### How It Works

1. **Game Start**: Both frontend and backend initialize empty played song tracking
2. **Round Start**: Manager selects "Start Round"
   - Frontend filters available songs, excluding already played songs
   - Frontend randomly picks from remaining songs
   - Frontend adds song ID to local `playedSongIds` set
   - Backend receives song data and adds ID to `used_song_ids` set
3. **Next Round**: Process repeats with smaller pool of available songs
4. **All Songs Played**: Frontend shows alert, preventing further rounds

### Benefits

- **Double Protection**: Both frontend and backend track played songs
- **Persistent Across Reconnects**: Backend tracking survives manager page refreshes
- **Clear User Feedback**: Alert when all songs exhausted
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses Set data structure (O(1) lookup)

## Deployment

### Backend Changes Deployed

1. Built new Docker image for websocket service
2. Pushed to ECR: `381492257993.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sound-clash/websocket-service:latest`
3. Deployed to ECS cluster: `websocket-service` in `sound-clash-cluster`

### Frontend

No frontend changes needed (features already implemented)

## Testing Checklist

### Display Answer Visibility
- [ ] Start game with 1+ teams
- [ ] Manager starts round
- [ ] Team buzzes
- [ ] Manager clicks ✓ Song → Song name appears on display
- [ ] Manager clicks ✓ Artist → Artist name appears on display
- [ ] Both answers visible until next round

### Random Song Selection
- [ ] Play multiple games with same genre selection
- [ ] Verify different songs appear in different order each game
- [ ] Confirm no predictable pattern across games

### Duplicate Prevention
- [ ] Start game, note available song count
- [ ] Play several rounds, tracking which songs played
- [ ] Verify no song plays twice
- [ ] When all songs exhausted, verify alert appears
- [ ] Verify "Start Round" button doesn't select already-played songs

---

## Notes

### Display Answers - Why It May Not Have Been Noticed

The feature requires BOTH components to be locked before appearing:
- If manager only approves song OR artist (not both), answers won't show
- Answers only appear after manager presses BOTH ✓ buttons
- This is by design - prevents spoiling before both components answered

### Song Selection - Database Level

Using `ORDER BY RANDOM()` is efficient for small-to-medium song libraries (< 10,000 songs). For very large libraries, consider these alternatives:
- Pre-shuffle song IDs in application layer
- Use sampling techniques (TABLESAMPLE)
- Cache randomized playlists per genre combination

### Duplicate Prevention - Game State

Currently, song tracking is in-memory only:
- Lost if backend service restarts during game
- Not shared across multiple backend instances (if scaled)
- For production at scale, consider storing in Redis or DynamoDB

|---------|--------|--------------|
| Display shows answers | ✅ Already working | None - already implemented |
| Random song selection | ✅ Already working | None - database ORDER BY RANDOM() |
| Duplicate prevention | ✅ Now enhanced | Added backend tracking to websocket service |

All three features are now fully operational!
